This repository contains the python notebooks of the tutorial on Federated Learning (FL). It includes examples of how to solve problems either at Horizontal (HFL) or Vertical (VFL) Federated Learning scenarios, using [TensorFlow Federated (TFF)](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated), [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) and [FATE](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE) frameworks.

It is divided into different use cases:
 * Use case 1. Image classification using deep learning in HFL
 * Use case 2. Sentiment analysis using deep learning in HFL
 * Use case 3. Decision trees in VFL
 * Use case 4. Introducing differential privacy
 * Use case 5. Clustering with k-means in HFL
 * Use case 6. Clustering with k-means in VFL
