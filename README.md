This repository contains the python notebooks of the tutorial on Federated Learning (FL) published at -. It includes examples of how to solve problems either at Horizontal (HFL) or Vertical (VFL) Federated Learning scenarios, using TFF, Flower and FATE frameworks.

It is divided into different use cases:
 * Use case 1. Training deep learning models in HFL scenario
   * Use case 1.1. Image classification
   * Use case 1.2. Sentiment analysis
 * Use case 2. Training classical ML algorithms in VFL scenario
 * Use case 3. Training with privacy
 * Use case 4. Unsupervised learning in FL
   * Use case 4.1. Clustering with k-means in HFL scenario
   * Use case 4.2. Clustering with k-means in VFL scenario
